# House Price Prediction
This is a machine learning model built using Python, Scikit-learn, and Pandas to accurately predict house prices based on various features. The model was trained on a dataset of house prices and features, and uses regression techniques to make predictions.



# Usage
To use the model, simply run the Flask web application. This can be done by running the following command:
python app.py
This will start the application on a local web server. You can then access the application by navigating to http://localhost:5000 in your web browser.
Once the application is running, you can input the features of a house (such as number of bedrooms, square footage, and location) and get an estimated price for that house based on the trained model.



# Model Details
The model was trained using a dataset of house prices and features. The dataset was preprocessed using Pandas to clean and transform the data, and Scikit-learn was used to split the data into training and testing sets, perform feature scaling, and train the regression model.
Hyperparameter tuning was performed using GridSearchCV to select the best combination of parameters for the model. The final model achieved an accuracy of XX% on the test set.


#Dependencies
The following dependencies are required to run the application:

Python 3.7 or later
Scikit-learn
Pandas
Flask
These dependencies can be installed using pip:
pip install scikit-learn pandas flask


# Credits
This project was developed by [Your Name Here]. The dataset used for training the model was obtained from [Source of Dataset], and the Flask web application was built using the Flask Mega-Tutorial as a guide.
